            <h4 class = "chart-title">JavaScript</h4>

            <p>Initially Self-Taught. Use JS for one of the class to render
                graphics.
                This website is hosted using
                NodeJS and Express Framework.</p>

            <h4 class = "chart-title">Html</h4>

            <p>Self-Taught. It is not difficult to make things appear on the
                browser. I feel it is more difficult to follow the right
                convention.</p>

            <p>Self-Taught. This is a render engine use for NodeJS. It is
                similar to HTML with the ability to embed JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Self-Taught. This is a render engine use for NodeJS. It is
                similar to HTML but there will be no usage of tags. Just
                indentations.</p>
